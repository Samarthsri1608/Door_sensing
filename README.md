# Door_sensing
Door Sensing is a project made out of Infrared Sensor and Arduino-Python connectivity. IR sensor senses the position of door, and if it opens, python script opens up a new window with a pre-set website

It may sound very vague to people, but i was prompted by my friends who needed to switch the windows very fast whenever someone entered in their room, as they would be seeing something which is not too appropriate (iykwim)...
